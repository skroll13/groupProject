                are in conjunction, meaning that they are closest together in the sky, on the same side of Earth (Sun→Moon→Earth).
                From our perspective, the Moon appears totally dark: We can not usually see it because we are facing the Moon's
                shadowed side, which does not receive any direct sunlight. But if we were to travel to the other side of the Moon,
                the part that faces the Sun, it would be totally illuminated.

                  we see a thin, crescent-shape Moon, which, in the Northern Hemisphere, appears on the right side. The lit area
                  slowly widens each day, covering more and more of the right side of the Moon's surface until the first quarter
                  phase, when the Moon's entire right side is illuminated. (In the Southern Hemisphere, the same thing happens, only
                  on the left side.)</p>

                <p class="card-text">This phase got its name because at this point the Moon has traveled 1/4 of the way through its
                  orbit. It's a confusing label, though, because at this time from our perspective, 1/2 of the Moon's surface is lit.
                  In fact, both the first and last quarter phases are sometimes called a Half Moon. At first quarter in the Northern
                  Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is illuminated; in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the left side. In actuality,
                  we are seeing 1/2 of the lit side of the Moon because the entire illuminated surface is only partly facing our
                  direction. In other words, the Moon is perpendicular to the Earth/Sun line. During a first quarter phase, the Moon
                  is said to be at east quadrature, meaning that it is 90 degrees east of the Sun when viewed from Earth.</p>

                  than half lit, but not yet fully. At the beginning of this stage in the Northern Hemisphere, we see the right half
                  of the Moon illuminated plus a tiny fraction more extending into the left side. As the days pass, the light creeps
                  farther left, covering more and more of the Moon's surface until the full Moon phase, when the entire disk is
                  illuminated. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same happens, only from left to right.
              
                  "Gibbous" comes from a Latin word meaning "humpbacked," referring to the curved lit area on the Moon's surface.</p>

                    Third Quarter. At this stage, we see 1/2 of the Moon's surface lit. In the Northern Hemisphere, the left side is
                    illuminated; in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the right side. During a last quarter phase, the Moon is said to be

                    crescent on the left side. Eventually, the entire disk will be in darkness, at which point it will be the new Moon
                    phase and another lunar cycle will have begun. (In the Southern Hemisphere, the same thing happens, only the lit
                    area would have started on the right side and shrunk from left to right, until a thin crescent remained on the
                    right.) Once the Sun rises, it is not easy to see this slim phase; the best time is before the glare of sunrise.</p>
